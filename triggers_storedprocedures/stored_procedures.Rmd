## Intro

A stored procedure is a segment of declarative SQL statements inside MySQL Server, similar to a method.

* declare a procedure using `create procedure` and execute it using `call`. Use `drop procedure` to remove it

```{sql eval = FALSE}
delimiter //
create procedure getCustomers()
begin
  select name, city
    from customers
   order by name;
end//
delimiter ;
```
```{sql eval = FALSE}
call getCustomers()
```

* invoking the same procedure prevents the need to recompile
* stored procedures can have parameters and control flow statements, eg. `if`, `case`, `loop`. 
* stored procedures can call other stored procedures

## Advantages

* **reduce network traffic**: don't have to send whole query, just procedure name
* **centralize business logic**: implement business logic reusable by multiple applications
* **Increase security**: dba can grant procedure privileges without access to underlying tables

## Disadvantages

* **Resource usages**: too many procedures increase memory usage 
* **Troubleshooting**: hard to debug ~ no facilities to debug in MySQL compared to other db's like Oracle
* **Maintenances**: requires specialized skills that could lead to problems with development and maintenance

## Variables 

To declare a variable inside a stored procedure, use `declare`

* can declare multiple variables with same type within one statement
* variables declared with an @ are session variables and available til the session ends - otherwise scope is within end statement.

```{sql eval = FALSE}
declare variable_name datatype(size) [default default_value];
```

To assign variables, use `SET`, or `SELECT INTO` in the case of result queries

```{sql eval = FALSE}
SET variable_name = value;
```

```{sql eval = FALSE}
SELECT COUNT(*)
  INTO productCount
  FROM products;
```

## Parameters

Parameters for a stored procedures have three modes: `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`. 

* `IN`: default
  * Calling program must pass argument to procedure. 
  * protected -- original value unchanged
* `OUT`
  * value can be changed inside stored procedure, value passed back to calling program
  * stored procedure cannot access initial value
* `INOUT` parameter may pass argument, stored procedure can modify value and pass new value back. 

To define, specify parameters within `create procedure`

```{sql eval = FALSE}
[IN | OUT | INOUT] parameter_name datatype[(length)]
```
