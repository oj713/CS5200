```

## Unions

* Join rows the same column names
* `UNION ALL` will include duplicate rows 
* Create additional constant value tables within the select statement to differentiate sources
* to merge discrete rows, add `''` to mark null columns

```{sql eval = FALSE}
/* store and online will be an unnamed column */
select 'STORE', saleID, subtotal, salesperson from StoreSales
 union all 
select 'ONLINE', saleID, subtotal, '' from OnlineSales
```

## Recursion and Hierarchical Queries ##

Example of an hierarchy: employees within a company have a `managerID` that points to their manager: ultimate boss is null

Consists of **anchor query** - where recursive process begins. 

**Recursive query** then joins to itself and continues re-runnning. 


```{sql eval = FALSE}
with employeeHier as ( -- temporary table
-- BOSS/CEO
select employeeID, name, managerID, 1 as [Level]
  from employeeTable 
 where managerID is null
 union all -- joining with next tier
select e.employeeID, e.name, e.managerID, eh.[Level] + 1 as [Level]
  from employeeTable e
 inner join employeeHier eh on e.employeeID = e.managerID
 where e.managerID is not null --deselecting CEO
) select * from employeeHier -- selecting from result table
```

## Partitioning 

* Order by is important because it determines a concrete order within each group
* `partition by` will return values for each individual within a partition, rather than lumping together by group like `group by`

```{sql eval = FALSE}
/* what percent of the total for the day is each order? */
select orderDate, salesID, totalDue,
       SUM(totalDue) over (partition by orderDate) as totalSales, -- total sales
       totalDue/sum(totalDue) over (partition by orderDate) * 100 as PctTotal -- percent of total 
  from storeSales
 order by orderDate, salesID
```

```{sql eval = FALSE}
/* creates numbers 1-n for each order by a salesperson */
select ROW_NUMBER() over ( partition by salespersonID order by orderDate) as RowNum, salespersonID, orderDate
  from storeSales
 where salespersonID is not null
```
