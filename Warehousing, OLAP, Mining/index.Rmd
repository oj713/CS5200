Organizations have large databases from collecting data on day-to-day activities, ranging from GB to TBs of data. 

* **OLTP**: online transactional processing applications that record and update data in such databases

# Data warehouses

*Subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, non-volatile collection of data in support of management's decisions* - Bill Inmon

**Data Warehouses** are databases consolidating data from multiple sources, augmented with summary info and historical data over time. 

* sources for warehouse can range from other databases to XML files to unstructured data, etc. and consolidate multiple sources (eg. marketing, outreach, sales)
  * contains data from most or all of organizations operational applications
  * data integrated and harmonized via ETL to ensure consistent views
* primarily queried and non-volatile - do not support transaction processing, recovery, or concurrency control
  * no data is overwritten or deleted - only loaded, refreshed, and accessed. 
* historical component allows for trend analysis (compare with transactional data)
  * can hold years or decades worth of data 
* **OLAP**: analysis of complex data from data warehouse
* **data mining**: automated derivation of patterns, clusters, and association

**Data Mart**: Subject-specific subsets of data geared towards the needs of a particular user. 

* improves speed and efficiency of analysis 
* can contain derived values

## Subject orientation

A data warehouse is organized around a major subject, eg. accounts, products, or orders.

Unlike an operational database which supports an application, the data is organized according to its subject. 

They change the perspective of the data to better enable analysis! 

# Data Warehouse architecture

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("files/datawarehousearchitecture.png")
```

**ETL** - Various source databases extracted and transformed into required data formats for warehouse and then uploaded. 

Data warehouse can be queried directly, but usually subset into **data marts** 

Usually very large and often spread across multiple databases, where summary data is stored alongside individual values.  

# OLTP vs DSS vs OLAP

**DSS**: Decision support systems, extracts high-level information in databases and uses that information to support decisions. Data warehousing, OLAP, data mining, and predictive modeling are all tools and techniques to build DSS. 

| **OLTP**        | **OLAP**      |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| Used online by users for specific, defined reasons | Used by managers/execs for unknown tasks | 
| Contains current data | Contains data snapshots |
| Contains unfiltered data | Contains filtered, converted data |
| Single data source | Multiple data sources |
| Continuous updates | periodic, versioned updates |

Data warehouses are only updated periodically - eg. weekly or monthly. 

* Redundancy is deliberate to improve access - summarized data, denormalized relational schemas, joins/aggregations/grouping avoided during retrieval

# Benefits for data warehouses

* more complete pictures for business decisions
* gain an advantage during competitive decision making
* find information otherwise non-accessible 
* reduces costs and increase profits by automating mining

# Integration Issues

Integrating data across multiple sources creates a host of issues: 

* category encodings and formatting
* field naming
* primary key selection
* duplicate data
* default values
* filtering and summarization
  * this one is tough because we don't know what data we need - often better off to store everything
  
**Backflushing**: after cleaning data via ETL data quality issues are often resolved and copied back to operational data sources.
