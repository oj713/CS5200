```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Question 1

**(20 pts) Create a normalized (BCNF) relational schema and visualize the schema in an ERD (in Crow's Feet/IE Notation) for the data in the XML file using a tool of your choice such as LucidChart. Include the ERD in your R Notebook.**

```{r out.width = '70%', fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://i.imgur.com/nQztzQz.png')
```

## Question 2

**(10 pts) Create a SQLite database that implements the schema, i.e., define the tables with CREATE TABLE. Use SQL chunks in your R Notebook.**

```{r}
library(RSQLite)

db <- dbConnect(SQLite(), "booksDB.db")
```

```{sql connection = db}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Book;
```
```{sql connection = db}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Author;
```
```{sql connection = db}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Catalog;
```
```{sql connection = db}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Genre;
```

```{sql connection = db}
CREATE TABLE Catalog(
  cid Integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
)
```

```{sql connection = db}
CREATE TABLE Author(
  aid Integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  aname Text NOT NULL
)
```

```{sql connection = db}
CREATE TABLE Genre(
  gid Integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  gname Text NOT NULL
)
```

```{sql connection = db}
CREATE TABLE Book(
  id Text NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  title Text NOT NULL, 
  edition Numeric, 
  price Numeric NOT NULL,
  publish_date Date NOT NULL,
  description Text NOT NULL, 
  genre Numeric NOT NULL REFERENCES Genre(gid), 
  author Numeric NOT NULL REFERENCES Author(aid), 
  catalog Numeric NOT NULL REFERENCES Catalog(cid)
)
```

## Question 3

**(30 pts) Load the XML data from the file into R data frames; you will need to use either node-by-node traversal of the XML tree or a combination of node-by-node traversal with XPath; you likely will not be able to accomplish it with only XPath. Use surrogate keys and/or the ID attributes in the XML to establish relationships.**

```{r}
library(XML)
library(stringr)

xml <- xmlParse("Books-v3.xml")

xpath_help <- function(...) {
  xpathSApply(xml, paste0(...))
}
```

```{r}
# create genre table
genres <- xpath_help("//book/genre/text()") |> 
  sapply(function(g) as(g, "character")) |>
  unique()

genres_df <- data.frame(gid = 1:length(genres), 
                        gname = genres)

head(genres_df)
```

```{r}
# create author table
authors <- xpath_help("//book/author/text()") |> 
  sapply(function(a) as(a, "character")) |>
  unique()

authors_df <- data.frame(aid = 1:length(authors), 
                         aname = authors)

head(authors_df)
```

```{r}
# create catalog tables
catalogs <- xpath_help("//catalog")

catalogs_df <- data.frame(cid = 1:length(catalogs))

head(catalogs_df)
```

```{r}
# helper function that creates a list for a book entry 
processBook <- function(book, cid) {
  # helper method to extract text for an element
  book_elem <- function(elem, type = "character") {
    xpathSApply(book, paste0(elem, "/text()"))[[1]] |> as(type)
  }
  
  # mandatory elements
  id <- xpathSApply(book, "@id")
  title <- book_elem("title")
  price <- book_elem("price", type = "numeric")
  publish_date <- book_elem("publish_date")
  description <- book_elem("description")
  
  # optional elements
  edition <- book_elem("edition", type = "numeric")
  if (length(edition) == 0) {edition <- NA}
  
  # references
  genre <- which(genres == book_elem("genre"))
  author <- which(authors == book_elem("author"))
  catalog <- cid
  
  list("id" = id, 'title' = title, 'edition' = edition, 'price' = price, 
       'publish_date' = publish_date, 'description' = description, 
       'genre' = genre, 'author' = author, 'catalog' = catalog)
}

# defining books base
books_df <- data.frame (id = character(0),
                       title = character(0),
                       edition = numeric(0),
                       price = numeric(0),
                       publish_date = character(0),
                       description = character(0),
                       genre = numeric(0),
                       author = numeric(0), 
                       catalog = numeric(0), 
                       stringsAsFactors = F)

# iterating through catalogs and by extension, books to create table
for (cid in catalogs_df$cid) {
  catalog <- catalogs[[cid]]
  
  books <- xpathSApply(catalog, "book")
  
  books_df <- do.call(rbind.data.frame, 
                      lapply(books, processBook, cid)) |>
    rbind(books_df)
}

head(books_df)
```

## Question 4

**(20 pts) Transform data types as necessary and then save the data frames to the appropriate tables in the database using a strategy of your choice (e.g., dbWriteTable()).**

```{r}
dbWriteTable(db, "Author", authors_df, overwrite = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(db, "Genre", genres_df, overwrite = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(db, "Catalog", catalogs_df, overwrite = TRUE)
dbWriteTable(db, "Book", books_df, overwrite = TRUE)
```

## Question 5

**(20 pts) Once the data from the XML is in the database, build SQL chunks for the following queries against the SQLite database:**

What is the number of genres have at least three books?

```{sql connection = db}
SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM (SELECT genre 
          FROM Book
         GROUP BY genre
        HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3)
```


What is the oldest year in which a publication was published?

```{sql connection = db}
SELECT MIN(strftime('%Y', publish_date)) as "Year"
  FROM Book
```

Find the number of books and average price for each genre.

```{sql connection = db}
SELECT genre, COUNT(*) AS numBooks, AVG(price) AS avgPrice
  FROM Book
 GROUP BY genre
```

List the title and author of all books that are less than 0.8\*AVG or more than 1.2\*AVG, where AVG is the average price of all books. As a predicate logic expression: \{ b : books(b) & (b.price < 0.8\*AVG(books.price) | b.price > 1.2*AVG(books.price)) \}

```{sql connection = db}
SELECT b.price AS Price, a.aname AS Author
  FROM Book b INNER JOIN Author a ON (b.author = a.aid)
 WHERE b.price/(SELECT AVG(price) FROM Book) NOT BETWEEN .8 AND 1.2
```
