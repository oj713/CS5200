```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Setup

```{r initialization}
# Initialization
library(RSQLite)
dbcon <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "OJohnson_db.db")
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
/* Enabling foreign key checking */
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON
```

### Creating Module 

Please note that the `number` attribute in the original schema was renamed to `mnumber` to avoid overlap with a reserved keyword. 

```{sql connection = dbcon}
/* Creating Module Table */
CREATE TABLE Module (
  mnumber TEXT NOT NULL, 
  title TEXT NOT NULL, 
  lengthInMin INTEGER NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT num_is_pk PRIMARY KEY (mnumber)
)
```

### Creating Author 

The affiliation list for `Author` is extensible because you can insert additional values into the lookup table. 

```{sql connection = dbcon}
/* Creating lookup table for author affiliation -
  choice to use name itself as primary key was deliberate choice to 
  improve clarity and ease of information access.
*/
CREATE TABLE Affiliation (
  atype TEXT NOT NULL, 
  CONSTRAINT at_is_pk PRIMARY KEY (atype)
);
```

```{sql connection = dbcon}
/* Creating Author Table */
CREATE TABLE Author (
  aid INTEGER NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL, 
  affiliation TEXT NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT aid_is_pk PRIMARY KEY (aid),
  CONSTRAINT aff_fk_aff FOREIGN KEY (affiliation) REFERENCES Affiliation(atype)
);
```

### Creating Author-Module Junction

```{sql connection = dbcon}
/* Creating Authorship junction Table */
CREATE TABLE Authorship (
  aid INTEGER NOT NULL,
  mnumber TEXT NOT NULL, 
  CONSTRAINT all_is_pk PRIMARY KEY (aid, mnumber),
  CONSTRAINT aid_fk_au FOREIGN KEY (aid) REFERENCES Author(aid),
  CONSTRAINT mnum_fk_af FOREIGN KEY (mnumber) REFERENCES Module(mnumber)
)
```

### Example Insertions

```{sql connection=dbcon}
INSERT INTO Affiliation (atype) VALUES
  ("PT"), ("FT"), ("Contract");
```
```{sql connection=dbcon}
INSERT INTO Author (aid, name, email, affiliation) VALUES
  (14, "John", "john@email.com", "FT"),
  (15, "Ash", "ash@email.com", "PT"),
  (16, "Doe", "doe@email.com", "PT"),
  (17, "Diane", "diane@email.com", "Contract");
```
```{sql connection=dbcon}
INSERT INTO Module (mnumber, title, lengthInMin) VALUES
  ("01", "Dogs in Nature", 12),
  ("02", "Fall leaves", 7),
  ("03", "Party planning", 90);
```
```{sql connection=dbcon}
INSERT INTO Authorship (aid, mnumber) VALUES
  (14, "01"),
  (14, "02"),
  (17, "03"),
  (15, "02");
```

### Disconnecting 

```{r close}
# disconnecting from database
dbDisconnect(dbcon)
```
```{r eval = FALSE}
# disconnecting from database
file.remove("OJohnson_db.db")
```
